# Hex
Classical game of Hex

This repository includes the source code in C++11, a compiled version (Windows 64-bits), and a configuration launch hex.bat file, which allows the change of board size, pie rule usage, first player (player or computer), colors...

Compilation instructions are included in the hex.cpp source code, which is the only source file needed.

Hex's Artificial Intelligence is a Monte-Carlo, and the software uses parallel threading for maximum efficiency.
